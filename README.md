# PuppyBowl

Welcome to PuppyBowl!

## Getting Started

1. Live serve `index.html`. The website should be blank!
2. Read through the comments of each function in `script.js` to get a sense of what this website should do once completed. **Do not** start writing code!
3. Read the example test specs in `script.test.js` for `fetchAllPlayers`.

## Instructions

1. Complete the API functions in `script.js` so all test cases pass when you run `npm test`.
2. Once all tests pass, complete the rest of the functions in `script.js`.
   - The render functions should change what you see when you live serve `index.html`.
